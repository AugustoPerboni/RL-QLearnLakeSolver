**About the Game:**  
Frozen Lake is a captivating challenge where the player has to cross a slippery frozen lake from the starting point to the goal. The twist? Avoid falling into any holes as you traverse the icy terrain! Given the slippery surface, the player might not always move in the intended direction, adding an element of unpredictability.

### 📖 **Strategy**
I've employed the **Q-learning** approach, a method in Reinforcement Learning, aiming to find a solution as close to optimal as possible.

### 🏆 **Results**
With the Q-learning algorithm at the helm, I managed to secure victories in approximately **70%** of the attempts. An intriguing balance between game mechanics and algorithmic prowess!
